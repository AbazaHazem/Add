# Go Add and File Reader

This simple Go program demonstrates two basic functionalities:

1. **Addition Function**: Adds two integers and prints the result.
2. **File Reader**: Reads and prints the contents of a specified text file.

## Files

- `main.go`: The main Go source file containing the logic.
- `example.txt`: A sample text file to demonstrate file reading.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository or create the files

Create a file named `main.go` and paste the code from the example. Also, create a text file named `example.txt` in the same directory with some content.

### 2. Run the Program

Make sure you have Go installed. Then run:

```bash
go run main.go
